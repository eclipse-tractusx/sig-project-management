- [ ] **Confirmation of _published_ CX Standards**
  
  Product Owner confirms:

  - The FOSS product under review is compliant to all relevant Catena-X Standards which are already published on the [Association website](https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library).
  - Failure to do so may ultimately make the reference implementation useless, as the mandatory CX Certification cannot be accomplished.

- [ ] **Verification of _foreseen_ CX Standards**
  
  Product Owner confirms:

  - The content of upcoming CX Standardization Requests (STAN) has been reviewed and feedback was provided to the responsible PCA/BDA. As per current status, the FOSS product under review will be compliant as soon as the CX Standard is published. ([Info here](https://confluence.catena-x.net/x/XtyAAQ)) (Source only accessible for Catena-X Consortia members in current transition phase.)
  - Minimum: PCA/BDA have finalized all release-relevant Standardization Requests (STAN). Those have passed the CX Association`s technical committee (TC4S) and are pre-published on the website. Opt-out period in progress.
  - Best case: Association Board approval available and CX Standard is published on website.
